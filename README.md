# PCB_defect_detection
Project Overview
PCB Defect Detection using the ResNet50 model is a machine learning project designed to automatically detect defects in printed circuit boards (PCBs). This project utilizes a deep learning model based on the ResNet50 architecture to classify PCB images as either defective or non-defective.
